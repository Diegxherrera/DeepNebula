Welcome back to the **JavaScript Crash Course** series! 🎉 In Part 6, we learned how to interact with the DOM and respond to user actions using **event listeners**. Now, in Part 7, we’re going to dive deeper into event handling. Specifically, we’ll cover **advanced event handling** techniques like event delegation and multiple event types. These skills will help make your code more efficient and responsive. Let’s get started! 🚀

## Refresh: What are Events? 🎯

An **event** in JavaScript is an action or occurrence—like a click, mouse movement, or keyboard press—that JavaScript can respond to. Events allow us to make our web pages interactive, listening for user actions and executing code in response.

## Understanding Event Propagation 🪜

When an event happens on an element, like a button click, it doesn’t just affect that element. The event propagates through the DOM in two phases:

1. **Capturing Phase**: The event moves from the root to the target element.
2. **Bubbling Phase**: After reaching the target, the event "bubbles" back up to the root.

By default, most events are in the **bubbling phase** when they are handled. You can specify which phase to use, but knowing about event propagation helps understand the next topic: **event delegation**.

## Event Delegation 🎳

**Event delegation** is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element to handle events from multiple child elements. Instead of adding event listeners to each item individually, we can take advantage of event bubbling.

### Why Use Event Delegation?

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of event listeners, improving performance.
- **Dynamic Elements**: Useful for handling events on elements created dynamically.

### Example of Event Delegation

Imagine we have a list of items, and we want to add a click event to each item. Instead of adding an event listener to each item, we can add one to the parent and use **event delegation**:

```html
<ul id="itemList">
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
let itemList = document.getElementById("itemList");

itemList.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
        console.log("You clicked:", event.target.innerText);
    }
});
```

In this example, we add a single event listener to the `ul` element. When any `li` element inside `ul` is clicked, we check if the target is an `li` and log its text. This way, we only need one event listener, even if new items are added to the list.

## Preventing Default Actions

Some HTML elements, like links and forms, have default behaviors. For example, clicking a link navigates to a new page. You can prevent these default actions with `event.preventDefault()`.

```html
<a href="https://example.com" id="myLink">Click me</a>
```

```javascript
let link = document.getElementById("myLink");
link.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log("Link was clicked, but default action prevented!");
});
```

In this example, clicking the link won’t navigate to a new page because we used `preventDefault()`.

---

## Handling Multiple Event Types 🖱️⌨️

Sometimes, you want to perform similar actions for multiple events, like handling both `click` and `keydown`. You can do this by attaching multiple event listeners, or combining logic within a single function.

```html
<button id="myButton">Click or Press Enter</button>
```

```javascript
let button = document.getElementById("myButton");

button.addEventListener("click", handleEvent);
document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
    if (event.key === "Enter") handleEvent(event);
});

function handleEvent(event) {
    console.log("Button activated by", event.type);
}
```

In this example, clicking the button or pressing Enter will trigger the `handleEvent` function.

## Event Throttling and Debouncing 🕰️

When dealing with events like `scroll` or `resize` that can trigger frequently, **throttling** and **debouncing** help control how often the event fires, improving performance.

### Throttling

**Throttling** ensures an event fires at most once every specified interval.

```javascript
function throttle(callback, limit) {
    let wait = false;
    return function() {
        if (!wait) {
            callback.apply(null, arguments);
            wait = true;
            setTimeout(() => {
                wait = false;
            }, limit);
        }
    };
}

window.addEventListener("resize", throttle(() => {
    console.log("Resizing...");
}, 500));
```

### Debouncing

**Debouncing** delays the execution until the event hasn’t fired for a specified time.

```javascript
function debounce(callback, delay) {
    let timeout;
    return function() {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            callback.apply(null, arguments);
        }, delay);
    };
}

window.addEventListener("scroll", debounce(() => {
    console.log("Scrolling stopped");
}, 200));
```

## Practice Challenge: Click Tracker 🎯

Let’s practice advanced event handling with a **Click Tracker**:

1. Create a button that, when clicked, logs "Button clicked!" only once every 1 second (using throttling).
2. Create a text input field that logs each key pressed after the user stops typing for 300ms (using debouncing).

### Example Solution

```html
<button id="clickButton">Click me!</button>
<input type="text" id="typeInput" placeholder="Type here" />

<script>
    function throttle(callback, limit) {
        let wait = false;
        return function() {
            if (!wait) {
                callback.apply(null, arguments);
                wait = true;
                setTimeout(() => {
                    wait = false;
                }, limit);
            }
        };
    }

    function debounce(callback, delay) {
        let timeout;
        return function() {
            clearTimeout(timeout);
            timeout = setTimeout(() => {
                callback.apply(null, arguments);
            }, delay);
        };
    }

    // Throttle example for button clicks
    const clickButton = document.getElementById("clickButton");
    clickButton.addEventListener("click", throttle(() => {
        console.log("Button clicked!");
    }, 1000));

    // Debounce example for typing input
    const typeInput = document.getElementById("typeInput");
    typeInput.addEventListener("input", debounce(() => {
        console.log("User stopped typing:", typeInput.value);
    }, 300));
</script>
```

## Wrapping Up

In this part, we explored **advanced event handling** with event delegation, handling multiple event types, and optimizing performance with throttling and debouncing. Mastering these concepts will make your JavaScript code more responsive, efficient, and scalable.

In Part 8, we’ll dive into **asynchronous JavaScript** and learn how to handle tasks that take time, like fetching data from a server. Stay tuned, and happy coding! 🎉
