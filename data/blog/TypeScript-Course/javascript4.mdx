Welcome back to the **JavaScript Crash Course** series! ðŸŽ‰ In Part 3, we learned about functions and scope, two essential tools for organizing code and controlling access to variables. Today, in Part 4, weâ€™re going to dive into **arrays** and **objects**. These are powerful structures that allow you to store, organize, and work with collections of data. Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€

## Arrays: Storing Lists of Data ðŸ“‹

An **array** is a special type of variable that can hold more than one value. Each value in an array is stored at a specific position, or **index**. Arrays are particularly useful when you have a list of items to work with.

### Creating an Array

You can create an array using square brackets `[]` and separate each item with a comma:

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

Here, `fruits` is an array containing three strings. You can access items in an array using their index, which starts at 0.

```javascript
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: "apple"
console.log(fruits[2]); // Output: "cherry"
```

### Adding and Removing Items

JavaScript provides several methods to add and remove items from arrays.

- **push()**: Adds an item to the end of the array.
- **pop()**: Removes the last item in the array.
- **unshift()**: Adds an item to the beginning of the array.
- **shift()**: Removes the first item in the array.

Example:

```javascript
fruits.push("orange"); // Adds "orange" to the end
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange"]

fruits.pop(); // Removes the last item ("orange")
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

### Looping through Arrays

You can loop through each item in an array using a `for` loop, or more conveniently with the `for...of` loop.

```javascript
for (let fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit);
}
```

## Common Array Methods ðŸ“š

JavaScript arrays come with many built-in methods that make working with data easier:

- **length**: Returns the number of items in the array.

  ```javascript
  console.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3
    ```

- **join()**: Converts all elements in an array into a single string.

  ```javascript
  console.log(fruits.join(", ")); // Output: "apple, banana, cherry"
    ```

- **indexOf()**: Finds the index of a specific item.

  ```javascript
  console.log(fruits.indexOf("banana")); // Output: 1
    ```

- **slice()**: Returns a portion of the array as a new array.

  ```javascript
  let newFruits = fruits.slice(0, 2); // ["apple", "banana"]
    ```

## Objects: Storing Key-Value Pairs ðŸ”‘

While arrays are great for lists, **objects** let you store data as **key-value pairs**. Each piece of data (or "property") in an object has a **key** (or "name") and an associated **value**.

### Creating an Object

You can create an object using curly braces `{}` and define key-value pairs inside.

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
};
```

Here, `person` is an object with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `city`.

### Accessing and Modifying Properties

To access a property in an object, you can use **dot notation** or **bracket notation**.

```javascript
console.log(person.name); // Output: "Alice"
console.log(person["city"]); // Output: "New York"
```

To modify a property, you can assign a new value to it.

```javascript
person.age = 31;
console.log(person.age); // Output: 31
```

### Adding and Removing Properties

You can add a new property to an object by simply defining it, and remove a property using the `delete` keyword.

```javascript
person.country = "USA"; // Adds a new property
console.log(person); // { name: "Alice", age: 31, city: "New York", country: "USA" }

delete person.city; // Removes the "city" property
console.log(person); // { name: "Alice", age: 31, country: "USA" }
```

## Looping through Objects

JavaScript allows you to loop through the properties of an object using the `for...in` loop:

```javascript
for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
```

This will output each key-value pair in the `person` object.

---

## Combining Arrays and Objects ðŸ§©

Arrays and objects can be combined to handle more complex data structures, like lists of objects.

### Example: Array of Objects

```javascript
let users = [
    { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
    { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
    { name: "Charlie", age: 35 }
];

// Accessing the first user's name
console.log(users[0].name); // Output: "Alice"

// Looping through the array
for (let user of users) {
    console.log(user.name + " is " + user.age + " years old.");
}
```

## Practice Challenge: Creating a To-Do List ðŸŽ²

Letâ€™s practice with a simple **To-Do List**!

1. Create an array called `todoList` with some initial to-do items as objects. Each item should have `task` (string) and `completed` (boolean) properties.
2. Add a function called `displayTodos` that loops through `todoList` and logs each task.
3. Add a function `addTodo` that adds a new task to `todoList`.
4. Test the functions by displaying the list, adding a new task, and displaying the list again.

Example Solution:

```javascript
let todoList = [
    { task: "Buy groceries", completed: false },
    { task: "Clean the house", completed: true },
    { task: "Pay bills", completed: false }
];

function displayTodos() {
    for (let item of todoList) {
        console.log(item.task + " - " + (item.completed ? "Done" : "Pending"));
    }
}

function addTodo(task) {
    todoList.push({ task: task, completed: false });
}

// Test
displayTodos();
addTodo("Walk the dog");
displayTodos();
```

## Wrapping Up

In this part, we explored **arrays** and **objects**â€”two essential data structures in JavaScript. With these tools, you can create and manage more complex data in your applications. In Part 5, weâ€™ll dive into **array and object methods**, and learn how to work with data even more efficiently.

Thanks for reading, and keep practicing! Your JavaScript skills are growing! ðŸŒ±
