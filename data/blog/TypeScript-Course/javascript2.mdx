Welcome back to our **JavaScript Crash Course** series! 🎉 In Part 1, we covered the basics like variables, data types, and simple operations. Now, in Part 2, we’re diving into **control structures**: conditionals and loops. These tools allow us to make decisions in code and repeat tasks, which is essential for dynamic and interactive applications. Let’s get started! 🚀

## Making Decisions: Conditionals 🌐

In programming, we often need to make decisions based on certain conditions. **Conditionals** let us do just that. In JavaScript, we use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to perform different actions depending on whether conditions are true or false.

### Basic Syntax for Conditionals

```javascript
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote!");
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
```

### `else if` for Multiple Conditions

If you have more than one condition to check, you can use `else if`:

```javascript
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("You got an A!");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    console.log("You got a B!");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    console.log("You got a C.");
} else {
    console.log("You need to study more.");
}
```

### `switch` Statements

When you have multiple conditions based on a single variable, a `switch` statement can be cleaner than multiple `if-else` statements:

```javascript
let day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("Start of the work week!");
        break;
    case "Friday":
        console.log("TGIF!");
        break;
    case "Saturday":
    case "Sunday":
        console.log("It's the weekend!");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Just another day.");
}
```

The `break` statement stops the execution from falling through to the next case. If you want multiple cases to lead to the same result (like "Saturday" and "Sunday"), you can stack them without a `break`.

## Repeating Actions: Loops 🔄

Loops let us repeat actions without writing out each action manually. JavaScript offers a few types of loops to choose from, and each has its best use case.

### `for` Loop

The `for` loop is great when you know how many times you need to repeat something.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log("Count:", i);
}
```

This loop will print numbers 1 through 5. The syntax is:

1. Initialize a variable (`let i = 1`).
2. Set a condition (`i <= 5`)—the loop runs while this is true.
3. Increment or change the variable (`i++`).

### `while` Loop

The `while` loop is useful when you don’t know the exact number of iterations beforehand.

```javascript
let count = 1;

while (count <= 5) {
    console.log("While count:", count);
    count++;
}
```

In this example, the loop will keep running until `count` is greater than 5.

### `do...while` Loop

The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it always executes **at least once** because the condition is checked after the code runs.

```javascript
let number = 1;

do {
    console.log("Do count:", number);
    number++;
} while (number <= 5);
```

### Breaking Out of Loops

You can use `break` to exit a loop early:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```

This will print numbers 1 to 4 and stop when `i` reaches 5.

### Skipping Iterations with `continue`

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i === 3) {
        continue; // Skip when i is 3
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```

This will print `1, 2, 4, 5`, skipping 3.

## Practice Challenge: FizzBuzz 🎲

Let’s try a popular programming challenge to practice loops and conditionals: **FizzBuzz**!

1. Write a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 20.
2. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
3. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
4. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Example Solution:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
        console.log("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
        console.log("Fizz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
        console.log("Buzz");
    } else {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```

## Wrapping Up

In this part, we covered some of the most powerful tools in JavaScript: **conditionals** and **loops**. With these, you can control the flow of your code, make decisions, and repeat actions as needed. These basics will serve as a foundation for more complex programs.

Stay tuned for Part 3, where we’ll explore **functions** and **scopes** in JavaScript! Thanks for reading, and happy coding! 🎉
