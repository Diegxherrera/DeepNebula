Welcome back to the **JavaScript Crash Course** series! ðŸŽ‰ In Part 4, we explored arrays and objectsâ€”two essential data structures in JavaScript. Now, in Part 5, weâ€™ll take things further by looking at **array and object methods**. These methods give us powerful ways to manage, transform, and access data. Ready to make data handling in JavaScript easier? Letâ€™s go! ðŸš€

## Array Methods ðŸ”„

JavaScript offers many built-in methods that allow us to manipulate arrays with ease. Here are some of the most useful ones:

### 1. `forEach()`

The `forEach()` method allows you to execute a function for each element in the array.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
fruits.forEach(fruit => {
    console.log(fruit);
});
```

### 2. `map()`

`map()` creates a new array by applying a function to each element in the original array.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let doubled = numbers.map(number => number * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

### 3. `filter()`

`filter()` creates a new array with only the elements that pass a certain condition.

```javascript
let ages = [12, 18, 25, 30, 14];
let adults = ages.filter(age => age >= 18);
console.log(adults); // Output: [18, 25, 30]
```

### 4. `reduce()`

`reduce()` reduces all elements in an array to a single value, like the sum of all numbers.

```javascript
let prices = [10, 20, 30];
let total = prices.reduce((sum, price) => sum + price, 0);
console.log(total); // Output: 60
```

### 5. `find()`

`find()` returns the first element that meets a specified condition.

```javascript
let numbers = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];
let found = numbers.find(num => num > 10);
console.log(found); // Output: 12
```

### 6. `some()` and `every()`

- **`some()`** checks if at least one element in the array meets a condition.
- **`every()`** checks if all elements in the array meet a condition.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

console.log(numbers.some(num => num > 3)); // true
console.log(numbers.every(num => num > 0)); // true
```

## Object Methods ðŸ”‘

Objects also have useful methods for working with their properties and values. Here are some essential ones:

### 1. `Object.keys()`

`Object.keys()` returns an array of an objectâ€™s property names (keys).

```javascript
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" };
console.log(Object.keys(person)); // Output: ["name", "age", "city"]
```

### 2. `Object.values()`

`Object.values()` returns an array of an objectâ€™s values.

```javascript
console.log(Object.values(person)); // Output: ["Alice", 25, "New York"]
```

### 3. `Object.entries()`

`Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs, which can be helpful for looping over an object.

```javascript
console.log(Object.entries(person));
// Output: [["name", "Alice"], ["age", 25], ["city", "New York"]]
```

### 4. `Object.assign()`

`Object.assign()` is used to copy properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

```javascript
let target = { name: "Alice" };
let source = { age: 25, city: "New York" };

Object.assign(target, source);
console.log(target); // Output: { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" }
```

### 5. `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()`

- **`Object.freeze()`** prevents any changes to an object (no adding, deleting, or modifying properties).
- **`Object.seal()`** prevents adding or deleting properties but allows modification of existing properties.

```javascript
let car = { brand: "Toyota", model: "Corolla" };

Object.freeze(car);
car.model = "Camry"; // This will have no effect
console.log(car.model); // Output: "Corolla"

Object.seal(car);
car.model = "Camry"; // This will work because seal allows modification
```

## Practical Example: Using Array and Object Methods ðŸŽ²

Letâ€™s create a small program to practice some of these methods.

### Task: Filtering and Displaying Students

1. Create an array of student objects. Each object should have a `name`, `age`, and `score`.
2. Filter students who scored above 70 and return their names.
3. Display the names in uppercase.

Example Solution:

```javascript
let students = [
    { name: "Alice", age: 22, score: 65 },
    { name: "Bob", age: 25, score: 85 },
    { name: "Charlie", age: 20, score: 75 }
];

let passedStudents = students
    .filter(student => student.score > 70)
    .map(student => student.name.toUpperCase());

console.log(passedStudents); // Output: ["BOB", "CHARLIE"]
```

## Practice Challenge: Analyzing Inventory ðŸš€

Letâ€™s put these methods to work with a small challenge involving an **inventory**:

1. Create an array of product objects, each with `name`, `price`, and `quantity` properties.
2. Write a function to calculate the **total inventory value** (price multiplied by quantity for each item).
3. Find the names of products where `quantity` is less than 5.
4. Use `map()` to display the names of these low-stock products in uppercase.

Example Solution:

```javascript
let inventory = [
    { name: "Laptop", price: 1000, quantity: 4 },
    { name: "Mouse", price: 25, quantity: 10 },
    { name: "Keyboard", price: 50, quantity: 3 },
];

// 2. Calculate total inventory value
let totalValue = inventory.reduce((sum, product) => sum + (product.price * product.quantity), 0);
console.log("Total Inventory Value:", totalValue); // Output: Total Inventory Value: 4275

// 3 & 4. Find and display low-stock products
let lowStockProducts = inventory
    .filter(product => product.quantity < 5)
    .map(product => product.name.toUpperCase());

console.log("Low Stock Products:", lowStockProducts); // Output: ["LAPTOP", "KEYBOARD"]
```
