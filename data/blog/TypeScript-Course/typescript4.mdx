Welcome back to the **TypeScript Crash Course**! 🎉 In Part 3, we explored functions and generics, adding flexibility to our code. In **Part 4**, we’ll dive into more advanced type management techniques: **type assertions**, **unions**, and **intersections**. These features allow us to handle complex data structures, work with multiple types, and take control of specific type behaviors. Let’s get started! 🚀

## What are Type Assertions? 🤔

**Type assertions** allow you to tell TypeScript that a value has a specific type, overriding TypeScript’s inferred type. This is useful in situations where TypeScript doesn’t have enough context to accurately determine a type.

### Syntax

There are two ways to use type assertions:

1. **Angle-bracket syntax**: `<Type>value`
2. **As-syntax**: `value as Type` (recommended in modern TypeScript)

### Example: Type Assertion

```typescript
let value: unknown = "Hello, TypeScript";

// Using angle-bracket syntax
let length1 = (<string>value).length;

// Using as-syntax
let length2 = (value as string).length;

console.log(length1); // Output: 17
console.log(length2); // Output: 17
```

In this example, we assert that `value` is a `string`, allowing us to access the `length` property.

## Working with Union Types 🔀

**Union types** allow a variable to hold values of different types. They’re defined using the `|` symbol and are helpful for handling scenarios where a value could be of multiple types.

### Example: Basic Union Type

```typescript
let id: string | number;

id = "abc123"; // Valid
id = 123; // Valid
// id = true; // ❌ Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.
```

Here, `id` can be either a `string` or a `number`, but nothing else.

### Union Types in Functions

Union types work well in functions, where different argument types may require different logic.

```typescript
function printId(id: string | number): void {
    if (typeof id === "string") {
        console.log("ID is a string:", id.toUpperCase());
    } else {
        console.log("ID is a number:", id.toFixed(2));
    }
}

printId("abc123"); // Output: ID is a string: ABC123
printId(123.45); // Output: ID is a number: 123.45
```

In this function, TypeScript narrows down the type using `typeof`, allowing us to handle `string` and `number` differently.

## Intersection Types 🔗

**Intersection types** combine multiple types into one. A variable with an intersection type must satisfy all the included types.

### Example: Intersection Type

```typescript
interface Name {
    name: string;
}

interface Age {
    age: number;
}

type Person = Name & Age;

let person: Person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25
};

console.log(person);
```

In this example, `Person` has properties from both `Name` and `Age`, requiring `person` to have both `name` and `age`.

---

## Combining Union and Intersection Types 🧩

Union and intersection types can be combined for more advanced type management.

### Example: Union of Intersections

```typescript
interface Dog {
    type: "dog";
    bark: () => void;
}

interface Cat {
    type: "cat";
    meow: () => void;
}

type Pet = Dog | Cat;

function interactWithPet(pet: Pet) {
    if (pet.type === "dog") {
        pet.bark();
    } else {
        pet.meow();
    }
}
```

In this example, `Pet` is a union of `Dog` and `Cat`. We use `type` to determine the type of pet, allowing us to call the appropriate method.

## Practical Example: Advanced Form Validation 📋

Let’s create a function to **validate form data** using union and intersection types.

1. Define an interface `UserForm` with `username` (string) and `email` (string).
2. Define an interface `AdminForm` with `role` (string) and `permissions` (array of strings).
3. Create a union type `Form` that can be either `UserForm` or `AdminForm`.
4. Write a function `validateForm` that validates based on the type.

### Example Solution

```typescript
interface UserForm {
    username: string;
    email: string;
}

interface AdminForm {
    role: string;
    permissions: string[];
}

type Form = UserForm | AdminForm;

function validateForm(form: Form): void {
    if ("username" in form) {
        console.log("Validating user form:", form.username, form.email);
    } else if ("role" in form) {
        console.log("Validating admin form:", form.role, form.permissions);
    }
}

const userForm: UserForm = { username: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" };
const adminForm: AdminForm = { role: "admin", permissions: ["read", "write"] };

validateForm(userForm); // Output: Validating user form: Alice alice@example.com
validateForm(adminForm); // Output: Validating admin form: admin [ 'read', 'write' ]
```

In this example, `validateForm` distinguishes between `UserForm` and `AdminForm` based on their properties, allowing for flexible validation.

## Practice Challenge: Flexible Shape Calculation 🎲

Let’s practice with a **shape calculator**.

1. Define an interface `Square` with `sideLength` (number).
2. Define an interface `Rectangle` with `width` and `height` (both numbers).
3. Create a union type `Shape` that can be either `Square` or `Rectangle`.
4. Write a function `calculateArea` that calculates the area based on the type.

### Example Solution

```typescript
interface Square {
    sideLength: number;
}

interface Rectangle {
    width: number;
    height: number;
}

type Shape = Square | Rectangle;

function calculateArea(shape: Shape): number {
    if ("sideLength" in shape) {
        return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    } else {
        return shape.width * shape.height;
    }
}

const square: Square = { sideLength: 5 };
const rectangle: Rectangle = { width: 4, height: 6 };

console.log("Square area:", calculateArea(square)); // Output: Square area: 25
console.log("Rectangle area:", calculateArea(rectangle)); // Output: Rectangle area: 24
```

This example uses a union type to calculate the area based on the shape’s properties.

## Wrapping Up

In Part 4 of our TypeScript series, we explored **type assertions**, **union types**, and **intersection types**. These tools give you control over complex type scenarios, allowing for greater flexibility and precision in your TypeScript projects.

In Part 5, we’ll wrap up the TypeScript series by exploring **type guards, enums, and advanced type manipulation** techniques. Thanks for following along, and happy coding! 🎉
