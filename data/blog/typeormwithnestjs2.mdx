## Introduction

Welcome back to the second part of our series on **Nest.js** and **TypeORM**. In Part 1, we covered the basics of setting up TypeORM in a Nest.js application, including defining an entity to represent a database table. Now, we’ll expand on that foundation by creating a **service** to handle database operations for our `User` entity. Services in Nest.js are where you encapsulate the business logic and interact with the database, making it easier to keep your application organized and maintainable.

## Creating a User Service

A service in Nest.js is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator. This tells Nest.js that the service can be injected into other components, like controllers, to provide database or other operations.

### Step 1: Generate the Service

Nest.js provides a command-line tool that makes it easy to generate new components. To create a service, use the following command:

```bash
nest generate service user
```

This command will create a `user.service.ts` file in a `user` directory. It includes a class with the `@Injectable()` decorator.

### Step 2: Import TypeORM Repository

To interact with our `User` entity in the database, we need to use a **repository**. A repository in TypeORM is a layer that gives you access to various helper methods like `find`, `save`, and `delete` for handling database operations.

In the `user.service.ts` file, import the `Repository` and `InjectRepository` from `@nestjs/typeorm` and inject the repository for the `User` entity.

```typescript
// src/user/user.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectRepository } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { Repository } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(User)
    private userRepository: Repository<User>,
  ) {}

  // Add methods here
}
```

### Explanation

- **@InjectRepository(User)**: This decorator injects the repository associated with the `User` entity.
- **userRepository: Repository`<User>`**: The `userRepository` property now has access to all TypeORM repository methods for managing `User` data.

## Implementing Service Methods

Let’s add some common methods for managing users in the `UserService`. We’ll cover three basic operations:

1. **Find All Users**
2. **Find One User by ID**
3. **Create a New User**

### 1. Find All Users

The `findAll()` method will retrieve all users from the database.

```ts
// src/user/user.service.ts

async findAll(): Promise<User[]> {
  return await this.userRepository.find();
}
```

### 2. Find One User by ID

The `findOne()` method will find a user by their unique `id`.

```ts
// src/user/user.service.ts

async findOne(id: number): Promise<User> {
  return await this.userRepository.findOne({ where: { id } });
}
```

### 3. Create a New User

The `create()` method will save a new user to the database.

```typescript
// src/user/user.service.ts

async create(userData: Partial<User>): Promise<User> {
  const newUser = this.userRepository.create(userData);
  return await this.userRepository.save(newUser);
}
```

### Explanation of the Methods

- **findAll()**: Uses `userRepository.find()` to return all users.
- **findOne(id: number)**: Uses `userRepository.findOne()` with a `where` clause to find a user by their ID.
- **create(userData: Partial`<User>`)**: Creates and saves a new user. `userRepository.create()` prepares the user entity, and `save()` persists it in the database.

## Adding the Service to a Module

To use this service in our application, we need to add it to a module (in this case, our `AppModule` or a dedicated `UserModule`).

```typescript
// src/user/user.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';
import { UserService } from './user.service';

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User])],
  providers: [UserService],
  exports: [UserService],
})
export class UserModule {}
```

### Explanation

- **TypeOrmModule.forFeature(`[User]`)**: Registers the `User` entity in this module.
- **providers**: Declares the `UserService` so it can be injected into other components.
- **exports**: Exports the `UserService` so it can be used by other modules.

## Conclusion

In this part, we created a **service** to handle database operations for our `User` entity, and we added common methods to find and create users. We also set up the `UserModule`, making the service accessible to other parts of the application. In **Part 3**, we’ll create a **controller** to define API endpoints, allowing us to interact with the user data through HTTP requests.

Stay tuned for Part 3, where we bring everything together with a controller to create a complete CRUD API for our `User` entity.
