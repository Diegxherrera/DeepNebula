## Introduction

Welcome to the third and final part of our series on **Nest.js** and **TypeORM**. In **Part 1**, we covered setting up TypeORM with a basic `User` entity, and in **Part 2**, we implemented a service to handle database operations for that entity. Now, in **Part 3**, we’ll bring it all together by creating a **controller** to define RESTful endpoints. This will allow us to interact with user data through HTTP requests, completing our simple CRUD API.

## What is a Controller?

In Nest.js, a controller is responsible for handling incoming requests, executing business logic (often by calling a service), and returning responses to the client. Controllers define routes that correspond to HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Step 1: Generate the Controller

To create a new controller, you can use the Nest.js CLI:

```bash
nest generate controller user
```

This command will create a `user.controller.ts` file in the `user` directory with a `UserController` class and basic structure.

### Step 2: Import the UserService

The `UserController` will use the `UserService` to handle database interactions. Import the service in your `user.controller.ts` file and inject it via the constructor.

```typescript
// src/user/user.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Post, Param, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserService } from './user.service';
import { User } from './user.entity';

@Controller('users')
export class UserController {
  constructor(private readonly userService: UserService) {}

  // Add route handlers here
}
```

### Step 3: Define the Routes

Now, let’s add route handlers for the basic CRUD operations: retrieving all users, retrieving a user by ID, and creating a new user.

#### 1. Retrieve All Users

This route will handle GET requests to `/users` and return all users.

```typescript
// src/user/user.controller.ts

@Get()
async findAll(): Promise<User[]> {
  return await this.userService.findAll();
}
```

#### 2. Retrieve a User by ID

This route will handle GET requests to `/users/:id` to find a specific user by their `id`.

```typescript
// src/user/user.controller.ts

@Get(':id')
async findOne(@Param('id') id: number): Promise<User> {
  return await this.userService.findOne(id);
}
```

#### 3. Create a New User

This route will handle POST requests to `/users` and create a new user.

```typescript
// src/user/user.controller.ts

@Post()
async create(@Body() userData: Partial<User>): Promise<User> {
  return await this.userService.create(userData);
}
```

### Explanation of Route Handlers

- **@Get()**: Maps GET requests to a route. In `findAll()`, it retrieves all users, and in `findOne(id)`, it retrieves a user by ID.
- **@Post()**: Maps POST requests to a route, allowing the creation of new data.
- **@Param()**: Retrieves parameters from the URL (like the `id` in `findOne`).
- **@Body()**: Retrieves data from the body of the request, as in `create`, where we pass in the user’s data.

## Testing the Controller

With these routes in place, we now have a simple CRUD API for the `User` entity. You can test these routes with a tool like **Postman** or **curl**.

- **GET /users**: Retrieve all users.
- **GET /users/:id**: Retrieve a user by ID.
- **POST /users**: Create a new user by sending JSON data in the request body.

Here’s an example of JSON data you might send in a POST request to create a new user:

```json
{
  "username": "new_user",
  "email": "new_user@example.com",
  "age": 25
}
```

## Final Project Structure

After implementing the entity, service, and controller, your `user` module directory should look like this:

```plaintext
src/user/
├── user.entity.ts         // Defines the User entity
├── user.service.ts        // Handles database operations
├── user.controller.ts     // Defines routes for the User API
├── user.module.ts         // Registers the User module and its components
```

This structure keeps each part of the codebase organized, making it easy to scale and maintain.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've completed the basics of integrating **Nest.js** with **TypeORM** to build a simple CRUD API. In this series, we covered:

1. **Entities and Attributes**: Setting up TypeORM and defining a User entity.
2. **Services**: Creating a service to encapsulate business logic and handle database operations.
3. **Controllers**: Defining endpoints for handling HTTP requests and interacting with our service.

Nest.js and TypeORM provide a powerful combination for building server-side applications with a structured and scalable architecture. From here, you can extend this API by adding additional endpoints, validation, error handling, and authentication. Happy coding!
